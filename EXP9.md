### DATE : 05-02-2025                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221040022
### AIM: 
To write a python program for sum of digits and validate the code using Pytest. 
### Algorithm:

1. Write the python program for sum of digits of a number. 
2. Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested 
should have assert keyword at the beginning. 
3. Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_sumofdig.py”. 
4. Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest is installed
5. Executethe program as “pytest test_sumofdig.py”. 
6. Stop the program.

### Program:
```
def sumOfDigits(n): 
sum = 0 
while (n != 0): 
sum = sum + int(n % 10) 
n = int(n/10) 
return sum 
def test_1(): 
assert sumOfDigits(123) == 6 
def test_2(): 
assert sumOfDigits(256) == 2 
```










### Output:

![383940670-0d28fe04-b47d-4e13-b71a-12f81f9d622b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdb48a12-42f8-4bf7-bc17-fb822f1313c5)


### Result:
Thus, the python program for sum of digits is tested using pytest and executed and output is verified successfully.
