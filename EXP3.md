### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221040022
### AIM: 
Write a python program to check the number is prime or not and inspect for failures.
 
### Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Get the number to be checked from the user.
3. If the number is less than or equal to 1, return "Not Prime".
4. If the number is 2, return "Prime".
5. Start the iteration from 3, For each iteration:
6. If the number is divisible by the current iteration value, return "Not Prime".
7. If the number is not divisible by any value from 2 to the square root, return "Prime".
8. Stop the program.

### Program:
```
num = input()
flag = 0

if num.isnumeric():
    z = int(num)
    if z == 2:
        flag = 1
    if z > 2:
        for i in range(2, z // 2):
            if z % i == 0:
                flag = 0
                break
        else:
            flag = 1
    if flag == 1:
        print("Prime Number")
    else:
        print("Not a Prime Number")
else:
    print("Enter a Positive Number")



```









### Output:
```
Enter a Positive number: 2
Prime number

Enter a Positive number: 5
Prime number

Enter a Positive number: krishna
Enter a positive number 
Reason: Strings are not allowed

Enter a Positive number: -1
Enter a positive number
Reason: Negative number are not allowed.

Enter a Positive number: 1
Not a Prime number 
Reason: The entered number is not a prime number.



```
### Result:
Thus, the python program to check the number is prime or not is implemented and the output is verified successfully.
